Codecademy's Lodash.js project is aimed to solidify implementation of methods from lodash.
I hope to accomplish this by using the following steps:
    1. Specify the functionality of the method we are implementing
    2. Ideate a game plan for how to implement this functionality in code
    3. Implement our game plan
    4. Test our code to ensure it works as expected
